## 1.27.0 - 2026-06-23

### Changed
- Overridden Git Flow for this repository: `main` is the only long-lived branch; no `develop` branch exists or should be created.
- All branch families (`feature/*`, `release/*`, `hotfix/*`) now base from `main` and target `main`.
- Updated preflight merge check to use `origin/main` instead of `origin/develop`.
- Removed back-merge requirements to `develop` from `release/*` and `hotfix/*` PR targets.

## 1.26.0 - 2026-06-23

### Added
- Added `docs/architecture-template.md` for documenting system context, components, tech stack, data flow, design decisions, deployment, integrations, security, and constraints.
- Added `docs/user-guide-template.md` for GUI and client-facing apps, covering navigation, key workflows, settings, troubleshooting, FAQ, and glossary.
- Added architecture and user guide guidance in `AGENTS.md`, including when to create and update each document.

## 1.25.0 - 2026-06-19

### Added
- Added CI/CD and workflow automation guidance.
- Added `docs/ci-cd-guidelines.md` for safe CI/CD changes, validation, and staged adoption.
- Added CI/CD completion checklist guidance.

### Changed
- Clarified that CI/CD workflow, deployment, secret, permission, and release automation changes require explicit task scope.
- Updated README links and sync metadata for pack version `1.25.0`.

## 1.24.0 - 2026-06-19

### Added
- Added comment discipline guidance for code, scripts, public API documentation, and generated documentation.
- Added summary discipline guidance for task summaries, PR summaries, and agent completion notes.
- Added examples showing useful comments versus obvious/noisy comments.

### Changed
- Updated completion and PR checklists to include concise comments/summaries.
- Bumped sync script metadata to pack version `1.24.0`.

## 1.23.0 - 2026-06-19

### Added
- Added mandatory Git/PR preflight guidance before agents create branches, start duplicate work, or open pull requests.
- Added duplicate-work protection for changes already merged into `develop` or already covered by an existing open PR.
- Added generic-example guidance so shared templates avoid project-specific enum/domain names.

### Changed
- Updated sync script metadata to pack version `1.23.0` and added remote fetch/prune during branch preparation unless skipped.
- Updated C# examples to use the generic `OrderStatusEnum` example instead of project-specific terminal enums.

## 1.22.0 - 2026-06-19

### Changed
- Renamed the repo-seed sync script from a versioned filename to the stable path `scripts/sync-agent-guidelines.py` so Git history tracks script changes cleanly.
- Clarified script filename/versioning guidance: scripts committed to a repository should use stable filenames, while distributed standalone copies, generated output files, and archive artifacts may use semantic-version suffixes.
- Updated sync examples, README links, and managed-file manifest paths to use the stable sync script name.

## 1.21.0 - 2026-06-19

### Added
- Added `scripts/sync-agent-guidelines.py` for syncing this pack from `repo-seed` into other repositories.
- Added `.agent-guidelines-version` to track the synced pack version in target repositories.
- Added repo-seed sync workflow guidance.
- Added managed-file hash tracking through `.agent-guidelines-manifest.json`.
- Added conservative conflict behavior that writes incoming versions under `.agent-guidelines-conflicts/`.
- Added separated Python and shell script convention files.

### Changed
- Replaced mixed branch type policy with strict Git Flow branch families: `feature/*`, `release/*`, and `hotfix/*`.
- Set `develop` as the default integration branch, normal PR target, and recommended hosted default branch for Git Flow repositories.
- Clarified that normal documentation, tests, refactors, chores, and non-emergency bug fixes use `feature/*` branches under strict Git Flow.
- Renamed the central guideline source example from `project-seed` to `repo-seed`.

## 1.14.0 - 2026-06-15

- Added `MUST` / `SHOULD` / `MAY` instruction strictness levels.
- Added rule to avoid AI assistant, tool, provider, or model names in branch names, commits, PR text, changelog entries, release notes, and generated helper text.
